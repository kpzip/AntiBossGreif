# AntiBossGrief
Minecraft Datapack that prevents the Wither and Ender Dragon from giving your world a makeover.
This datapack only prevents the Wither and Ender Dragon from destroying blocks by flying through them. The wither's initial explosion and the Wither's skull projectiles can still destroy blocks.
# Installation
Place the zip file in your world's "datapacks" folder, and type /reload in game
